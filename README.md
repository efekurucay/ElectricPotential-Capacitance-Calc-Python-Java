# Electric Potential Calculation

This project is prepared for the Spring 2024 Physics II assignment at Akdeniz University.
PDF writes instructions in the document.

## Overview

In this project, a 10x10 matrix is created, and the electric potential at each cell is calculated. The charge (q) is located at the bottom left corner of the matrix. The electric potential is calculated according to Coulomb's law:
